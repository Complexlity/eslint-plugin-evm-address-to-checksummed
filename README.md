# eslint-plugin-evm-address-to-checksummed

This plugin converts all evm addresses to their checksummed version

Test it on [Stackblitz](https://stackblitz.com/edit/node-w37mw5?file=README.md)

## Installation

You'll first need to install [ESLint](https://eslint.org/):

```sh
npm i eslint --save-dev
```

Next, install `eslint-plugin-evm-address-to-checksummed`:

```sh
npm install eslint-plugin-evm-address-to-checksummed --save-dev
```

## Usage

Add `evm-address-to-checksummed` to the plugins section of your `.eslintrc` configuration file. You can omit the `eslint-plugin-` prefix:

```json
{
    "plugins": [
        "evm-address-to-checksummed"
    ]
}
```


Then, configure the rules you want to use under the rules section.

```json
{
    "rules": {
        "evm-address-to-checksummed/evm-address-to-checksummed": "error",
        "evm-address-to-checksummed/case-typo-in-evm-address": "error"
    }
}
```

## Rules

There are two rules:
1. `case-typo-in-evm-address`
2. `evm-address-to-checksummed`

The reason for rule 1 is, some address can be invalid due to uppercase values in an incorrect place (could be due to invalid checksumming or just a typo). This would not hit the rule 2 (main) rule as that rule only seeks to lint valid addresses.

This ensures flexibility as that function can be disabled at will rather than bundling both functions in a single rule
